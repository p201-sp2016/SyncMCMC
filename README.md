# SyncMCMC
Bayesian modeling of synchrotron emission using MCMC 

This package implements affine-invariant Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods in order to fit synchrotron spectra to emission from relativistic jets. The bulk Lorentz factor of the jet, number density of electrons, and physical source size are obtained from minimal energy equipartition arguments.
